DESCRIPTION
I have made this School Website by takin the idea from my college website www.manit.ac.in. Here on the upper-left corner of the homepage of our project I have added three items which is ‘Home’, ‘About Us’, ‘Contact’. And on the upper-right corner I have added the three icons of most popular social media website and added the link of my social media account. By clicking on those icons one can check out my social media account as we don’t have official social media account for our website.
Next and the biggest photo is the photo of our college of size 90*540. The Campus Tour Section is also there where students can checkout Campus life of the college.
To take the admission in any school/college, everyone want to take admission in a reputed college so I have also added the Rankings given by Indian govt. to the Institutes, So that everything should be transparent.
And last but not least we have four sections which is Administration, Contact Us, Connect, Useful Links where student can contact to the college by mail/mobile no. or can checkout some other useful links.
In the About Section, we have all the courses covered by our college like here we have Btech, MCA, Mtech, Phd and some useful description of that course and if you want to read more related to that course then you must click on “Read more” which can take you to the other website(Wikipedia).
Next, we have added the description of our campus where one can read about the biggest campus and then he/she can see the photos of college campus and fests photos too.
Here, when we click on the Contact on the upper-left corner then it will takes you to the page where you should have to fill the form in case of any additional query. And on the right side there is a route map in case of not finding the college directly.
That’s it.
